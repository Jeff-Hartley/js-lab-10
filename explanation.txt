I added an explanation to my commit method for this.

I had been distracted with exams and realized I had created a repo and uploaded
everything with one commit. I deleted that past repo, created a new one, and made three main commits:

index
js
css

I already had the code done so I couldn't commit as I went. I recognize this isn't ideal, but also
noticed there isn't a commit goal to reach for this lab.

Just wanted to explain what had happened on my end and why I commited the way I did
